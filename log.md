# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished http://learnyouahaskell.com/types-and-typeclasses, tried to do something in ghci env.

**Thoughts:** It's really hard to learn haskell after couple years of expirience of procedure programming. 
But yeah, it's also very interesting at all.
