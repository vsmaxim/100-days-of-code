# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished starting out from LYAHFGG, tried to do something in ghci env.

**Thoughts:** It's really hard to learn haskell after couple years of expirience of procedure programming. 
But yeah, it's also very interesting at all.

### Day 2: September 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished types and typeclasses, started pattern matching from LYAHFGG. Got understanding of how 
types and typeclasses are inferred in Haskell.

**Thoughts:** Haskell has strict typisation, it's like a sip of clear water after Python.
