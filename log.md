# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished starting out from LYAHFGG, tried to do something in ghci env.

**Thoughts:** It's really hard to learn haskell after couple years of expirience of procedure programming. 
But yeah, it's also very interesting at all.

**Link to work:** [Examples that I've done in repository](https://github.com/vsmaxim/100-days-of-code)


### Day 2: September 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished types and typeclasses, started pattern matching from LYAHFGG. Got understanding of how 
types and typeclasses are inferred in Haskell.

**Thoughts:** Haskell has strict typisation, it's like a sip of clear water after Python.

### Day 3: September 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished topics about function and recursion. Also found that implementing the functions
from tutorial without reading how it's implemented at first is challenging thing. 

**Thoughts:** Haskell is really about functions. It really makes your brain think in another way than it does everyday.
Also, catched myself at the point that I didn't know what recursion really is, but yeah, it's become clear today to me.

### Day 4: September 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished topic about high-ordering functions. Got more understanding how the things done in Haskell.
Wrote my first algorithm in Haskell without checking the book.

**Thoughts:** It becomes more and more impressive for me. Haskell is HUGE!

**Link to work:** Same as always.
